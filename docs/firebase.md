# Firebase setup instructions for DAQ.

DAQ uses a simple Firebase-hosted web page to provide a dynamic dashboard
of test results.

## Initial Setup

0. There should be a GCP project that can be used to host everything.
1. Goto the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and add a new project.
   * Add the hosting GCP project to link it to this Firebase setup.
2. Navigate to the
[Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service accounts page]
(https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?project=daq-project)
   * This is <em>not</em> from the Firebase page: it has to be from the base GCP page.
   * Create a new service account with a semi-meaningful name like `daq-testlab`.
   * Add the _Pub/Sub Admin_, _Storage Admin_, _Cloud Datastore User_, and _Firebase Admin_ roles.
   * Furnish a new private key.
4. Install the downloaded key into the DAQ install.
   * Copy the download JSON key file to the `daq/local/` directory.
   * Edit `daq/local/system.conf` to specify the `gcp_cred` setting to point to the downloaded file
     (with a path relative to the `daq/` install directory), e.g.
     `gcp_cred=local/daq-testlab-de56aa4b1e47.json`.
5. (Re)Start DAQ (`cmd/run`).
   * There should be something in the top 10-20 startup log lines that look something like:
     <br>`INFO:gcp:Loading gcp credentials from local/daq-testlab-de56aa4b1e47.json`
     <br>`INFO:gcp:Initialized gcp publisher client daq-project:daq-testlab`
6. Follow the [Firebase CLI setup instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/).
7. Goto the 'daq/firebase/` directory.
   * Run `firebase use` to set the GCP project to use (as created above).
   * Run `firebase deploy` to deploy the necessary parts of the system.
   * Follow the link to the indicated _Hosting URL_ to see the newly installed pages.

## Datapath Debugging

The data for DAQ reporting through to Firebase goes through a number of distinct steps. This
section outlines the basic steps to help diagnose and debug the system, past "it doesn't work!"

1. <em>DAQ GCP Connection:</em>
When the system starts up and runs, there should be some descriptive log messages that highlight
operation, with obvious error messages when something goes wrong:<pre>
<em>...</em>
INFO:gcp:Loading gcp credentials from local/daq-testlab-de56aa4b1e47.json
INFO:gcp:Initialized gcp pub/sub daq-project:daq-testlab
INFO:gcp:Initialized gcp firestore daq-project:daq-testlab
<em>...</em>
INFO:gcp:Uploaded test report to inst/report_9a02571e8f00.txt
<em>...</em>
</pre>

2. <em>PubSub Topic & Subscription:</em>
On the [GCP PubSub Topics page](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topicList), there
should be an entry for a `projects/daq-project/topics/daq_runner` topic, with at least one
subscription to something like `projects/daq-project/subscriptions/gcf-daq_firestore-daq_runner`,
which is the linked Firestore cloud function.

3. <em>Cloud Function:</em>
The [GCP Cloud Functions page](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/list) should show a
`daq_firestore` function, and if you look at the logs there should be `info` events for each
reported stage of DAQ test, e.g.:<pre>
I  daq_firestore 210626605171528 updating 1537561337615 daq-laptop port-undefined undefined status daq_firestore 210626605171528
I  daq_firestore 210625487917242 updating 1537561337804 daq-laptop port-1 5ba552f2 sanity daq_firestore 210625487917242
I  daq_firestore 210621644751867 updating 1537561338017 daq-laptop port-1 5ba552f2 info daq_firestore 210621644751867
I  daq_firestore 210625202516197 updating 1537561338223 daq-laptop port-1 5ba552f2 dhcp daq_firestore 210625202516197
I  daq_firestore 210621107285036 updating 1537561362562 daq-laptop port-1 5ba552f2 info daq_firestore 210621107285036
I  daq_firestore 210617247716870 updating 1537561362716 daq-laptop port-1 5ba552f2 dhcp daq_firestore 210617247716870
I  daq_firestore 210615717506431 updating 1537561362986 daq-laptop port-1 5ba552f2 base daq_firestore 210615717506431</pre>

4. <em>Firebase Use Logs:</em>
The same Cloud Functions are represented in Firebase and can be viewed as part of the
[Firebase Functions Usage Logs](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/daq-project/functions/usage/current-billing/execution-count)
(note that you'll have to manually replace `daq-project` with the appropriate `{projectId}` in order for that link to work).
The logs there will also show any signficant errors highlighting most problems.

5. <em>Firestore Database:</em>
The data ends up in the
[Firestore Database](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/data/origin?project=daq-project)
(again replacing `daq-project` with the appropraite `{projectId}`)
and filed under `origin/{accountId}` (the name of the service account) of the DAQ install supplying the data.

6. <em>Web Application:</em>
The test [Web Application](https://daq-project.firebaseapp.com/) (again, will have to substitute the appropriate `projectId`),
should show a list of all accounts with ingested data. If nothing is showing here, or the `accountId` is missing,
check the web dev console to see if there's any obvious errors.
