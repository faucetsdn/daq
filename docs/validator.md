# Validator Setup

The `validator` is a sub-component of DAQ that can be used to validate JSON files or stream against a schema
defined by the standard [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) format. The validator does not itself specify
any policy, i.e. which schema to use when, rather just a mechanism to test and validate.

The "schema set" is a configurable variable, and the system maps various events to different sub-schemas within
that set. Direct file-based validations run against an explicitly specified sub-schema, while the dynamic PubSub
validator dynamically chooses the sub-schema based off of message parameters. There's currently two schemas
available, defined in the `validator/schemas/` subdirectory:
* `simple`, which is really just there to make sure the system works.
* [`abacab`](../validator/schemas/abacab/README.md), which is a building-oriented schema for data collection.

## Validation Mechanisms

There are several different ways to run the validator depending on your specific objective, outlined below.

### Local File Validation

Local file validation runs the code against a set of local schemas and inputs. The example below shows
validating one schema file against one specific test input.
Specifying a directory, rather than a specific schema or input, will run against the entire set.
An output file is generated that has details about the schema validation result.

<pre>
~/daq/validator$ <b>bin/run.sh schemas/simple/simple.json schemas/simple/simple.tests/example.json</b>

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3s

Executing validator schemas/simple/simple.json schemas/simple/simple.tests/example.json...
Running schema simple.json in /home/user/daq/validator/schemas/simple
Validating example.json against simple.json
Validation complete, exit 0
</pre>

### Integration Testing

The `validator/bin/test.sh` script runs a regression suite of all schemas against all tests.
This must pass before any PR can be approved. If there is any failure, a bunch of diagnostic
information will be included about what exactly went wrong.

<pre>
~/daq/validator$ <b>bin/test.sh</b>

</pre>

### PubSub Stream Validation

Streaming validation validates a stream of messages pulled from a GCP PubSub topic. There are three values required
in the `local/system.conf` file to make it work:
* `gcp_cred`: The service account credentials, as per the general [DAQ Firebase setup](firebase.md).
* `gcp_topic`: The _PubSub_ (not MQTT) topic name.
* `gcp_schema`: Indicates which schema to validate against.

You will need to add full Project Editor permissions for the service account.
E.g., to validate messages on the `projects/gcp-account/topics/telemetry` topic, there should be something like:

<pre>
~/daq$ <b>fgrep gcp_ local/system.conf</b>
gcp_cred=local/gcp-project-ce6716521378.json
gcp_topic=telemetry_topic
gcp_schema=validator/schemas/abacab/
</pre>

When using the
[GCP Cloud IoT Core MQTT Bridge](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/mqtt-bridge#publishing_telemetry_events)
there are multiple ways the subschema used during validation is chosen.
* An `events` message is validated against the sub-schema indicated by the MQTT topic `subFolder`. E.g., the MQTT
topic `/devices/{device-id}/events/pointset` will be validated against `.../pointset.json`.
* [Device state messages](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/config/getting-state#reporting_device_state)
are validated against the `.../state.json` schema.
* All messages have their attributes validated against the `.../attributes.json` schema. These attributes are
automatically defined by the MQTT Client ID and Topic, so are not explicitly included in any message payload.
* (There currently is no PubSub stream validation of device config messages.)

Running the `bin/validate` script will will parse the configuration file and automatically start
verifying PubSub messages against the indicated schema.
The execution output has a link to a location in the Firestore setup
where schema results will be stored, along with a local directory of results.
